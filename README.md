# Snapdrop
Android app for [Snapdrop.net](https://snapdrop.net) - The easiest way to transfer files across devices on same wifi or hotspot.

This app is a wrapper around [snapdrop project](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) using webview and some javascript interface for downloads.

Install from **[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.snapdrop)** or **[APK release](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Snapdrop/releases)**.

### Advantages
You can select files on your phone share it directly using this app, instead of opening a browser and searching for the files. 
I'm also planning to add a download/upload history section once the following issues are fixed.

### Known issues
- It changes the downloaded file name.
- Might not support downloading some file types. (Please create an issue, mention the file type and attach the file too, if possible.)
